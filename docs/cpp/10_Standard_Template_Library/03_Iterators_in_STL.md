description: In this tutorial, we'll explore STL iterators in C++. We'll cover the different types of iterators, such as input, output, forward, bidirectional, and random-access iterators. You'll learn how to use iterators to traverse and manipulate data in STL containers. Understanding STL iterators is crucial for effective data manipulation and for leveraging the full power of the Standard Template Library in your C++ programs.
