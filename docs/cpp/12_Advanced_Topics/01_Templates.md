description: In this tutorial, we'll explore templates in C++. We'll cover the basics of function and class templates, allowing you to write generic and reusable code. You'll learn how to define and use templates to create functions and classes that can work with any data type. Understanding templates is essential for writing flexible and efficient C++ programs, enabling you to implement powerful and type-safe abstractions.
