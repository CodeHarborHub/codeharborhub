description: In this tutorial, we'll explore dynamic memory allocation in C++. We'll cover how to use the `new` and `delete` operators to allocate and deallocate memory at runtime. You'll learn about managing heap memory, pointers, and avoiding memory leaks. Understanding dynamic memory allocation is essential for creating flexible and efficient C++ programs that handle varying amounts of data dynamically.
