description: In this tutorial, we'll explore smart pointers in C++. We'll cover the different types of smart pointers, such as `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`, provided by the C++ Standard Library. You'll learn how to use these smart pointers to manage dynamic memory automatically and safely, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers. Understanding smart pointers is essential for modern C++ programming, enabling you to write more robust and maintainable code.
