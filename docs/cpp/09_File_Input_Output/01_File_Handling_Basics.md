description: In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of file handling in C++. We'll explore how to open, read, write, and close files using the standard library's file stream classes. You'll learn about input and output file streams, as well as the functions and methods for manipulating file data. Understanding file handling is essential for C++ programs that need to interact with external files, enabling you to store and retrieve data efficiently.
