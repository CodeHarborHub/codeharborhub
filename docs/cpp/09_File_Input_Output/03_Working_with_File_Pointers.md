description: In this tutorial, we'll explore working with file pointers in C++. We'll cover how to manipulate file pointers to navigate through files for reading and writing operations. You'll learn about functions like seekg, seekp, tellg, and tellp, which allow you to control the position of the file pointer. Understanding file pointers is essential for advanced file handling tasks, enabling precise control over file I/O operations in your C++ programs.
