description: In this tutorial, we'll explore reading and writing to files in C++. We'll cover how to use file stream classes to open files, read data from files, and write data to files. You'll learn about ifstream for reading files, ofstream for writing files, and fstream for both reading and writing. Understanding how to read from and write to files is crucial for data persistence and interaction with external data sources in C++ programs.
