description: In this tutorial, we'll focus on exception handling best practices in C++. We'll cover guidelines and techniques to effectively handle exceptions in your code, ensuring robustness and maintainability. You'll learn about when to use exceptions, how to design exception hierarchies, and how to handle exceptions gracefully. Additionally, we'll discuss resource management and exception safety guarantees to prevent memory leaks and ensure program stability. Understanding exception handling best practices is crucial for writing reliable and resilient C++ applications that can gracefully handle unexpected errors and exceptions.
