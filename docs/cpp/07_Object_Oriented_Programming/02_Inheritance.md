description: In this tutorial, we'll dive into inheritance in C++. We'll explore how to create derived classes that inherit properties and behaviors from base classes. You'll learn about different types of inheritance, such as single, multiple, and hierarchical inheritance, along with the use of access specifiers like public, protected, and private. Understanding inheritance is key to building flexible and scalable C++ programs, allowing you to reuse code and create complex class hierarchies with ease.
