description: In this tutorial, we'll explore polymorphism in C++. We'll delve into how polymorphism allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, enabling dynamic method binding and runtime polymorphic behavior. You'll learn about virtual functions, abstract classes, and the use of pointers and references to achieve polymorphic behavior. Understanding polymorphism is crucial for building flexible and extensible C++ programs, facilitating code reuse and enhancing code maintainability and readability.
