When a web browser requests an HTML file from a web server, it begins the process of parsing the HTML code. Parsing involves interpreting the HTML tags and their attributes to understand the structure and content of the web page.

## The HTML Parsing Process
**1. Tokenization**: The browser breaks the HTML code into individual tokens, which are the basic building blocks of HTML. Tokens can be HTML tags, attributes, or text content.

**2. Lexical Analysis**: The browser analyzes each token to determine its type and whether it is a valid HTML element. This step ensures that the HTML code follows the correct syntax and structure.

**3. Syntax Analysis**: The browser checks the HTML code for any syntax errors, such as missing or mismatched tags, and reports any errors it finds.

**4. DOM Construction**: The browser constructs a Document Object Model (DOM) tree based on the parsed HTML structure. The DOM tree represents the elements on the page and their relationships, allowing the browser to manipulate and interact with the content.

**5. Rendering**: After constructing the DOM tree, the browser proceeds to render the web page. Rendering involves interpreting the CSS styles applied to the HTML elements and laying out the content according to these styles. The browser combines the HTML structure, CSS styles, and any JavaScript interactions to display the web page as intended by the developer.

## How Browsers Handle User Interactions?
Web browsers also handle user interactions with the web page, such as clicking links, submitting forms, or interacting with multimedia content.
**1. Handling User Input**: When a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking a link or submitting a form, the browser sends a request to the web server to process the user's input. The server then responds with the updated content, which the browser renders accordingly.

**2. Handling Multimedia Content**: JavaScript, a scripting language commonly used in web development, allows developers to create dynamic and interactive elements on the page. Browsers execute JavaScript code to respond to user actions and update the page dynamically. This includes handling events such as mouse clicks, key presses, and form submissions.

**3. Handling JavaScript Interactions**: Browsers handle multimedia content such as images, videos, and audio files by downloading and rendering them according to the specified formats and settings. For example, a browser may download an image file and display it on the page, or play a video file using the browser's built-in media player.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, HTML works with web browsers by providing the structure and content of web pages through a set of markup symbols or codes. Browsers interpret these codes to display text, images, links, and multimedia content, allowing users to navigate the web and access information seamlessly.
